## 🧱 About the Project

This project challenges me to design and build a **comprehensive website for TechCon 2024** using only HTML.
The site is divided into multiple pages, each dedicated to a specific section of the conference — such as history, mission, schedule, and registration — while following semantic web design best practices.

All code is **W3C-compliant**, accessible, and uses HTML tags appropriately to convey meaning and structure.

## 🎯 Project Scope

The TechCon 2024 website consists of **five core pages**:

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)** – Introduces TechCon 2024, highlights its purpose, and includes an embedded promotional video.
2. **About Page (`about.html`)** – Explores the history, mission, and notable speakers of the conference.
3. **Schedule Page (`schedule.html`)** – Displays the full event schedule in a structured and accessible table.
4. **Register Page (`register.html`)** – Allows users to register for the conference via a user-friendly HTML form.
5. **Contact Page (`contact.html`)** – Provides contact information, social media links, an embedded map, and a contact form.

## 🧩 Concepts Covered

Throughout this project, I practiced and applied:

* **HTML Structure:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Headings and Text:** Correct hierarchical organization using `<h1>`–`<h6>` and `<p>`.
* **Links and Navigation:** Creating page navigation with `<a>` tags.
* **Tables:** Structuring tabular data for the event schedule using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<caption>`.
* **Forms:** Building registration and contact forms with various input types (text, email, checkbox, etc.).
* **Images and Multimedia:** Embedding images, videos, and maps using `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<iframe>` tags.
* **Accessibility and Semantics:** Ensuring all elements are descriptive, meaningful, and screen-reader-friendly.
